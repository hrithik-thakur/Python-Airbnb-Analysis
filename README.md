In this project, I explore a rich dataset to uncover valuable insights about Airbnb listings, pricing trends, and guest preferences. Using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn, I have highlighted key patterns and trends that can benefit both the company and travelers.

**Key Highlights:**

Detailed analysis of Airbnb listings.
Pricing trends and factors affecting pricing.
Guest preferences and popular amenities.
Insights for improving listings and attracting more bookings.
